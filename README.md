# [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/cloudmu/react-redux-starter-kit)

Yet another React and Redux based web application starter kit.
### Install and Run the Dev Server

```
npm install
npm start
```
Then open http://localhost:3000

### Demo
A demo of this web application is running on a free [Amazon EC2 Micro Instance](http://ec2-52-89-200-19.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/), with very limited resources.

### Overview

This is yet another React and Redux based web application starter kit. However, this one attempts to go beyond the typical simple boilerplates, by showcasing several great technologies (such as [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux), [React-Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router), [Fixed-Data-Table](https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table), [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), [Babel](http://babeljs.io), and [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io)) used together to develop a more complex web application, with features such as navigation, asynchronous data fetching, error handling, caching and pagination, etc.

### Feature highlights

* Best React practice by [separating "smart" and "dumb" components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)
* Async Data fetching with caching and pagination
* Data fetching error handling
* Page Restrictions

### Dependencies

* React
* Redux
* React Router
* Fixed-Data-Table
* style-loader
* Bootstrap
* Express
* Babel
* Webpack

### Credits

For a long-time backend developer (who enjoys writing obscure number-crunching "optimzation" algorithms in Java), I would never have thought of developing (let alone posting) a web application using javascript on Github, were it not for the fateful summer 2015 when I stumbled upon a 30 minutes video by [Dan Abramov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs), and his subsequent inspiring work on [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux).

Thank you!
